üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Set of CLIs to scaffold and build React Native libraries for different targets.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/).

## Development workflow

This project uses a monorepo using `yarn`. To setup the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

While developing, you can run watch mode to automatically rebuild the changes:

```sh
yarn watch
```

To test the CLI locally, you can point to the appropriate executable:

```sh
../bob/packages/create-react-native-library/bin/create-react-native-library
```

Before sending a pull request, make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

## Alternatives

There are other similar tools to scaffold React Native libraries. The difference is that the generated project with `create-react-native-library` is very opinionated and configured with additional tools.
